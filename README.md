This project is part of an introductory training process.
The idea is to learn Django, Django-rest-framework and other relevant technologies.
It consists of the official Django polls application as a base, extended with a restful api. Other features will be added as the training advances.

This project uses pipenv for package management.

- Features to add in the future:
    - Faker for better test data
    - Patch endpoints for CRUDs
    - Permission per Model restrictions
    - Endpoints for Admins only
    - Fix admin page to work with Answer model
